				<ol>
					<li>We may transfer our rights and obligations under this EULA to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or your obligations under this EULA. You may not transfer your rights or obligations under this EULA to another person.</li>
					<li>This EULA (and any document expressly referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement between us and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between us, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.

					<li>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this EULA, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations.
