Germinate Scan
=======

Germinate Scan is designed to make scanning and storing barcodes easy! Just connect an external barcode scanner to your Android device and start scanning or use your device's inbuilt camera. Germinate Scan will scan barcodes as a row of a key and multiple values, i.e. the first code represents the key while the following codes in the row are the values. All scanned codes are tagged with the time and date of the scan event as well as the geographic location of the device if GPS is enabled. As long as the attached barcode scanner is connected as an input device, Germinate Scan can handle all types of bar codes the scanner is able to read. All scanned bar codes are saved in an internal database to make sure that you can continue exactly where you left off. The database can be exported to a text file at any time.

Germinate Scan has many potential uses such as the recording of field trial data. We also have a desktop application to allow Germinate Scan users to create cheat sheets of barcodes for scanning: https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-humbug
